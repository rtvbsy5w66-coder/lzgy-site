## 🔧 Technical Configuration

### Workflow Triggers

| Event | Branches | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Push** | `main-for-vercel`, `develop` | Full CI + Production/Preview Deploy |
| **Pull Request** | `main-for-vercel`, `develop` | Full CI + Preview Deploy + PR Comments |
| **Config Changes** | Any | Configuration Validation Only |

### Environment Variables

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel API authentication
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Organization identifier  
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Project identifier

**Automatic Environment:**
- `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true` - Set automatically for CI builds
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Set for production deployments

### Performance Optimizations

- **Node.js caching** - Speeds up dependency installation
- **Parallel job execution** - Lint, test, and security run simultaneously
- **Artifact sharing** - Build outputs shared between jobs
- **Concurrency control** - Cancels outdated runs automatically

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Branch Strategy

**Production Flow:**
```
feature-branch → develop → main-for-vercel → production
```

**Preview Flow:**
```
feature-branch → Pull Request → Preview Deployment
```

### Deployment Environments

| Environment | Trigger | URL Pattern | Health Checks |
|-------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Preview** | Pull Request | `*.vercel.app` | Basic connectivity |
| **Production** | Main branch push | Custom domain | Full health suite |

### Rollback Strategy

- **Vercel Dashboard** - One-click rollback to previous deployment
- **Git Revert** - Automatic rollback via Git history
- **Manual Override** - Emergency deployment bypass available

---

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with coverage reporting
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript validation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with Next.js rules
- **Security**: npm audit with vulnerability scanning
- **Configuration**: Automated config validation
- **Integration**: Health checks post-deployment

### Performance Monitoring

- **Build Time**: Target < 5 minutes (currently ~3 minutes)
- **Bundle Size**: Monitoring with 500KB+ file alerts
- **Health Response**: < 2 seconds for critical endpoints
- **Deployment Time**: Complete cycle < 8 minutes

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Failures**: Non-critical errors don't block deployment
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in for network-dependent operations
- **Fallback Behavior**: Degraded functionality vs complete failure
