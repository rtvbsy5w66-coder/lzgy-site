# GitHub Release Creation Template

**BLOCKING ISSUE**: GitHub Secret Scanning prevents automatic tag push due to OAuth secrets in git history.

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Problem**
Git history contains OAuth secrets in commit `7631bbdb` that trigger GitHub push protection:
- `.env.local.bak` and `.env.local.bak2` files contain Google OAuth credentials
- GitHub Security prevents tag push until secrets are resolved

### **Resolution Options**

#### **Option A: Allow Secrets (Quick)**
1. Visit GitHub URLs provided in error message:
   - https://github.com/footballinvestment/lovas-political-site/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/32rD3ACYPXAuMSbHBIb3WjbXVEx
   - https://github.com/footballinvestment/lovas-political-site/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/32rD36oGuPauLdFYvgqZN0QFWPK
2. Mark secrets as "used in tests" or "false positive"
3. Retry git push origin v1.0.0

#### **Option B: Clean History (Recommended)**
1. Use git filter-branch to remove sensitive files from history
2. Force push clean history (DESTRUCTIVE - coordinate with team)
3. Recreate and push v1.0.0 tag
